# greeleyCMSImport
Utility class/plugin for importing from my custom CMS that I created and have used with dozens of clients. Will port all content to WordPress MU.

After shortcode executes, will output redirect commands for .htaccess file. Copy/paste to .htaccess or httpd.conf file.

# Shortcode: 
  
  [importsite]
  
  ex. [importsite sourcesite="fire"], where sourcesite is the name of the previous directory name
